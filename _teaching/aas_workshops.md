I have helped co-organize hands-on machine learning workshops for two winter meetings of the American Astronomical Society (AAS). I have also implemented and presented tutorials as a tutorial lead.



Design & Contents
======

My tutorials focuses on the morphological classification of CANDELS galaxies from the GOODS-S field. To keep the focus on the machine learning discussion, the classification task involved is a relatively simple one: predicting whether a given galaxy has an elliptical or disk morphology. I have implemented a module that extracts the required data from the public CANDELS imaging and catalogs, and performs the necessary preprocessing prior to being used within individual tutorials. We have utilized the classification scheme developed by the CANDELS collaboration (details in [Kartaltepe et al. 2015]('https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/221/1/11')) to select the sample of elliptical/disk galaxies we used.

Detailed information on the rest of the workshop, and access to the publicly available tutorial Jupyter notebooks can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/aas237mlworkshop).

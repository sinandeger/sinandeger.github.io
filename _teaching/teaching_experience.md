I have had the opportunity to teach numerous classes during my education as a graduate student. Here be a few highlights. 


Teaching Experience at the University of Kansas
======

**PHSX 516 -  Physical Measurements** 

A senior / early graduate student level laboratory course emphasizing experimental techniques and data analysis, as well as scientific writing and presentation skills. The numerous experiments (at least 20 experimental setups) explore a range of classical and modern physics topics. I was assigned as the TA for the course for two consecutive semesters; Fall 2015 and Spring 2016.

This paper we are working on with Prof. Greg Rudnick focuses on the determination and analysis of the stellar population content of ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS) galaxies.

The image above is compiled following the full-spectrum pPXF fitting we performed. The observed rest-frame spectrum of the galaxy is shown in gray. Overplotted on it is the best-fitting stellar component shown in black.
